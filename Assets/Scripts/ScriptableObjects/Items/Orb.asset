    textResponse: 'the orb glows the color of a late sun reflected off the sea. you
      gaze upon it, and the light pulses slightly. you try to look away but your
      eyes are pulled back to it.


      you should take it. '

    textResponse: 'you approach the orb. the still-glowing ground is hot in places,
      you burn your feet, but that is not at the front of your mind.


      you
      stand above it, it pulses again. you take it. you feel... powerful. you hold
      the orb in both hands, no longer aware of the burning in your feet.

      the
      hunger in your gut subsides.


      after a moment of gazing into it, the
      orb ceases its glow. the beasts and bugs resume their night sounds. you ought
      to go home.


      <color=purple>but we will protect you</color>'
